| T1A2-4                              | **Develop** an **outline** of the user interaction and experience for the application. Your outline must include: - how the user will find out how to interact/use each feature - how the user will interact/use each feature - how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user | Please include this in your **software development plan** as a separate section with an appropriate heading. | CMP1041-2.1, CMP1041-2.3 |

## User Interaction and Experience

Once the user has cloned the Git Repo https://github.com/Miktoms/First-Assignment.git they will need to be in the folder;

##### mnt/c/Projects/Assesments/Assessment 1 Plan and Implement a Terminal Application/src

Once there the command they will need to enter is; 

###### python3 app.py 

to run the program.

Once the program is running the program will ask a question of the user and the user will type their answerto the right of the question.

The program will then display another line for either:

If the input is outside of the scope of the program and/or is an error that the program can't process a prompt will display a command for the input being more specific about the details required for the answer to be calculated.

| T1A2-5                   | **Develop** a diagram which describes the control flow of your application. You diagram must: - show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature. - utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML. | Please provide a image file or PDF of your diagram.  Please include this in your **software development plan** as a separate section with an appropriate heading. | CMP1041-3.2 |

| T1A2-13 | **Utilise** a project management platform to track the development of the application by: - having features itemised and broken down into checklists - setting deadlines, duration or a time-frame for each feature or task - prioritising tasks | You must submit screenshots, or a valid export from a project management application to satisfy this requirement. If you are using a non-standard project management application, please discuss with your trainer whether they can access the file. If in doubt, screen capture your project management application and submit screen captures. | CMP1041-6.2 |
