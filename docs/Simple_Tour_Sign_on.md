# Tour Guiding Sign in App

Michael Toms 27/06/2019

## Purpose of the App:

The Application is designed to capture details of tour members before they start the tour and display that information to the organisers so that problems can be avoided and opportunities to engage with the customers can be maximised. By capturing this information before the tour is booked this reduces the time spent by tour employees entering customer details into the tour management system. The information will help inform the tour guide and organisers of details required to make the tour as seamless and accommodating as possible. When booking the tour International Tourists and locals wanting a day trip will be asked to supply the information through to terminal.
