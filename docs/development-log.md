# Development Log

## Status update #1  28 Jun 2019 10:30am

I started with a larger development plan that included at least 4 features drawing from a list I was going to write and saving the responses to another file. It also included adding at least 9 features to add information to that file that would be input by the user. After working on this for a day I realised that I would struggle to design this many features in the time available as my coding knowledge 4 weeks ago was just about zero. Realising that the minimum number of features required for the app is 3, I drew up an alternate plan to achieve this minimum requirement so that I made it achievable and I plan to build from this once I have completed the minimum required.

As this is an input heavy app and User Input can't be tested, in order to test the features I need to re-write the code so that the object of the functions can be tested away from the input commands. To do this I have added functions;

def *get_greeting* to *def get_name* so that the program still runs without error

*def day_break* to *def get_day*

*def month_break* to *def get_month*

and also changed the origin functions so that the program would still run.

This has overcome a significant roadblock I was having and will allow me to finish the code so that I can then concentrate on putting together the Documentation for the rest of the Assessment tonight.
