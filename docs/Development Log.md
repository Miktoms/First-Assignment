# Development Log

## Status update #1

I started with a larger development plan that included at least 4 features drawing from a list I was going to write and saving the responses to another file. It also included adding at least 9 features to add information to that file that would be input by the user. After working on this for a day i realised that I would struggle to design this many features in the time available as my coding knowledge 4 weeks ago was just about zero. Once I realised that the minimum number of features is 3 I drew up an alternate plan to achieve this minimum requirement so that I made it achievable and I plan to build from this once I have completed the minimum required.
